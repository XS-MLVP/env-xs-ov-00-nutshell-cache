# NutShell Cache Verification Experiment Based on MLVP Tools

Official website: [open-verify.cc](https://open-verify.cc/)

## Learning Materials

Complete the study of the materials ([https://open-verify.cc/mlvp/docs/](https://open-verify.cc/mlvp/docs/)), understand the basic verification knowledge. And complete the creation of NutShell cache DUT based on the example code in it.

## Function Points and Test Points

Refer to the NutShell cache code and corresponding documents, list the function points, and then split the test points according to the function points.

NutShell cache document: [https://oscpu.github.io/NutShell-doc/%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E9%83%A8%E4%BB%B6/cache.html](https://oscpu.github.io/NutShell-doc/%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E9%83%A8%E4%BB%B6/cache.html)

NutShell cache source code: [https://github.com/OSCPU/NutShell/blob/master/src/main/scala/nutcore/mem/Cache.scala](https://github.com/OSCPU/NutShell/blob/master/src/main/scala/nutcore/mem/Cache.scala)


## Test Cases

Based on the function points and test points from the previous step, write test cases that can cover all test points.


## Test Coding

Write test code based on the test cases, which needs to include the writing of function coverage points. For details, you can refer to the mlvp project: [https://github.com/XS-MLVP/mlvp](https://github.com/XS-MLVP/mlvp)

## Test Report

Complete the test report, the test report needs to include the analysis corresponding to the function coverage rate and the code line coverage rate. The function coverage rate is required to reach 100%, and the effective code line coverage rate needs to reach 96% or more.
